This post first appeared on the [LShift web site](http://www.lshift.net/blog/2006/06/21/s5-a-simple-standards-based-slide-show-system/).

Whilst discussing presentation software the other day with a colleague, he kindly pointed me at S5. It is simple, it is standards-based, and it is a slide show system. In short, it does exactly what is says on the tin:

> S5 is a slide show format based entirely on XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With one file, you can run a complete slide show and have a printer-friendly version as well. The markup used for the slides is very simple, highly semantic, and completely accessible. Anyone with even a smidgen of familiarity with HTML or XHTML can look at the markup and figure out how to adapt it to their particular needs. Anyone familiar with CSS can create their own slide show theme. It’s totally simple, and it’s totally standards-driven.
